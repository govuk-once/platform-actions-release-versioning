# Reusable GitHub Actions workflows

This repository contains centrally maintained GitHub Actions workflows for GOV.UK App services.

Application repositories remain responsible for their own quality checks, builds, tests and deployments. These workflows provide a consistent release contract without centralising service-specific deployment logic.

## Available workflows

| Workflow                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml`      | Determines whether a release is required, creates the Git tag and GitHub release, and returns explicit release outputs. |
| `.github/workflows/release-notification.yml`  | Sends a Slack notification for major and minor production releases. Patch releases are silently skipped.                |

## Semantic release

### Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    name: Create Release
    uses: govuk-once/github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml@v1
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    with:
      node-version: "24"
```

### Inputs

| Input          | Required | Default | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node-version` | No       | `24`    | Node.js version used to install dependencies and run semantic-release. |

### Outputs

| Output     | Description                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `released` | `true` when a release was created; otherwise `false`.                           |
| `version`  | New semantic version without the `v` prefix. Empty when no release was created. |
| `type`     | `major`, `minor` or `patch`. Empty when no release was created.                 |

Callers access the outputs through the release job:

```yaml
${{ needs.release.outputs.released }}
${{ needs.release.outputs.version }}
${{ needs.release.outputs.type }}
```

### Calling-repository requirements

The workflow checks out and runs against the calling repository. Each caller must contain:

- a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file;
- the `semantic-release` package
- a semantic-release configuration such as `.releaserc.json`.

For example:

```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "tagFormat": "v${version}",
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

## Release notification

Sends a Slack notification when a major or minor release is deployed to production. Patch releases are silently skipped.

The notification includes the release notes, a link to the GitHub release and a link to the deployment run.

### Usage

Chain it after the semantic release job:

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    name: Create Release
    uses: govuk-once/github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml@v1
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write

  notify:
    name: Notify
    needs: release
    if: needs.release.outputs.released == 'true'
    uses: govuk-once/github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/release-notification.yml@v1
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    with:
      application: my-service
      version: ${{ needs.release.outputs.version }}
      type: ${{ needs.release.outputs.type }}
      slack-channel: "#my-release-channel"
    secrets:
      deployment-role: ${{ secrets.AWS_DEPLOYMENT_ROLE }}
```

### Inputs

| Input           | Required | Default     | Description                          |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `application`   | Yes      | —           | Human-readable name of the service.  |
| `version`       | Yes      | —           | Semantic version without `v` prefix. |
| `type`          | Yes      | —           | `major`, `minor` or `patch`.         |
| `slack-channel` | Yes      | —           | Slack channel to post to (e.g. `#my-release-channel`). |
| `aws-region`    | No       | `eu-west-2` | AWS region for credential exchange.  |

### Secrets

| Secret            | Required | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `deployment-role` | Yes      | IAM role ARN assumed via OIDC to send the notification. |

## Repository access

For private repositories, configure this repository under **Settings → Actions → General → Access** so approved organisation repositories can call its workflows.

Calling repositories must also permit actions and reusable workflows from this repository under their GitHub Actions policy.

## Versioning and compatibility

Consumers should reference an approved major version:

```yaml
uses: govuk-once/github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml@v1
```

Workflow releases should use immutable semantic-version tags such as `v1.0.0`. A maintained `v1` tag may point to the latest backwards-compatible `v1` release.

The following changes are considered breaking and require a new major version:

- removing or renaming an input, output or secret;
- changing the meaning or format of an output;
- requiring additional caller permissions;
- changing notification eligibility; or
- changing behaviour in a way that requires caller modifications.

Callers should not reference `@main` in production workflows.
